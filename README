🚀 About Me @DevRaulOliveira

👋 Hello, world! I’m Raul, 30 years old. An enthusiast of technology and innovation, currently diving into the IT universe as an intern at Scania Latin America. Here, I’m at the forefront of the sustainable transport sector, contributing with my skills in administrative and operational areas. My journey began with a technologist degree in Automotive Mechanics from FATEC Santo André in 2021.

🌱 I’m currently building a solid foundation of my knowledge, with emphasis on data and system development. However, always willing to be acquiring new knowledge about everything, after all, what is life without being lived?

👨‍💻 Education and Skills I’m in constant evolution, currently improving my knowledge in Systems Analysis and Development at FATEC São Paulo. I’m fascinated by the power of data and how they can transform the world around us. That’s why I’m specializing in databases, Power BI, and other crucial tools for system development. My goal? To be a catalyst for digital transformation and innovation in the industry, driving efficiency and sustainability through technology.

💡 Passions and Hobbies When I’m not coding or unraveling data, you can find me at the gym, keeping the body as active as the mind. I’m an avid gamer, always ready for the next challenge in online games. My love for cars extends from the garage to the road, and my soundtrack is a vibrant mix of electronic music and synthwave. I’m an aficionado of JDM culture, and in moments of relaxation, I dive into the world of anime, movies, and series.
